# Smart-parking-using-IoT-and-Android
In the development of traffic management systems, an intelligent parking system is needed, 
to reduce the complexity of parking and for optimal use of resources 
for car-park owners. Currently, the common method of finding a parking space is manual where the driver usually finds a 
space in the street through luck and experience, if not then search for the place nearby, but this process can take time. 
This process takes time and effort and may lead to the worst case of failing to find any parking space if the driver 
is driving in a city with high vehicle density. The alternative is to find a predefined car park with high capacity. 
However, this is not an optimal solution because the car park could usually be far away from the user destination. 
This study aimed to provide information about nearby parking spaces for the driver and to make a reservation minutes earlier using 
supported devices such as smartphones or tablet, it is based on Internet of things. Furthermore, the services use the 
Car Number of each vehicle in booking a parking space. However, the current intelligent parking system does not provide an 
overall optimal solution in finding an available parking space, does not solve the problem of load balancing, does not 
provide economic benefit, and does not plan for vehicle-refusal service. To resolve the aforementioned problems and take advantage 
of the significant development in technology, the Internet-of-Things technology (IoT) has created a 
revolution in many fields in life as well as in smart-parking system (SPS) . The present study proposes and develops an 
effective cloud-based SPS solution based on the Internet of Things. Our system constructs each car park as an 
IoT network, number of free slots in car park areas will be transferred to the data centre. costs is decided 
according to the timing for which user is booking the slot. The SPS is based on several innovative technologies 
and can automatically monitor and manage car parks. This research is based on Iot and Android and using 
Ultrasonic sensors and IR sensors implementation is done. This research also implements a 
system prototype with wireless access in an open-source physical computing platform based on 
Raspberry Pi using a smartphone that provides the communication and user interface 
for both the control system and the vehicles to verify the feasibility of the proposed system.
